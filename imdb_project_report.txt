IMDb Movie Ratings - Project Report

Project Description:
This project involved scraping, cleaning, and preprocessing data from IMDb’s Top 250 movies list. The objective was to transform unstructured web data into a well-organized and usable dataset for analysis or modeling.

Tools Used:
- Python 3
- Requests – for accessing the IMDb webpage
- BeautifulSoup (bs4) – for HTML parsing
- Pandas – for data manipulation
- Regex (re) – for formatting duration and genre fields

Process Summary:

Scraping:
- Accessed the IMDb Top 250 page using the requests library.
- Bypassed scraping restrictions (HTTP Error 430) by adding a User-Agent header that mimics a real browser.
- Parsed the HTML using BeautifulSoup.
- Switched to extracting data from the embedded JSON inside <script type="application/ld+json"> for cleaner and more structured content.

Cleaning:
- Checked for missing values (none found).
- Checked and removed duplicates (none found).
- Standardized text fields like genre and duration for consistency.

Preprocessing:
- Parsed and reformatted the ISO 8601 duration (e.g., PT2H32M) into both:
    • A readable string format like "2H 32M"
    • A numeric format in total minutes
- Extracted the primary genre from multiple listed genres.
- Converted appropriate columns to correct data types (e.g., float for rating, int for duration).

Challenges and Solutions:

1. IMDb Blocking Requests:
   Solution: Used a user-agent in the headers to bypass restrictions.
   Code snippet:
   headers = {
       'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36'
   }
   requests.get(url, headers=headers)

2. Difficulty parsing titles/ratings from HTML tables:
   Solution: Switched to parsing structured JSON data embedded in the page.

3. Duration in ISO Format:
   Solution: Used regex to convert the ISO string (e.g., PT2H30M) to total minutes and a readable time string.

Output:
- Final cleaned dataset: final_IMDB_dataset.csv
- Includes fields like: Title, Rating, Genre, Duration_Minutes, URL, Description, etc.
- Ready for exploratory data analysis, visualization, or further machine learning modeling.
